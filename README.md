- You don't have to run this since it is already deployed. However, please note that the deployed instance runs on a free tier, so it may take a while for it to start running again if it's currently inactive.

If you want to run it locally:

- Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
- Install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You may need to manually install some packages.
- Run `flask run`.
- Make sure to manually change the fetch URL in the React code.
